👋 Hey there!  
This LibreWolf build is currently on **vacation mode 🏖️** — not abandoned, just on a short *coffee break* ☕.  

Main blocker: a **linking issue** — my `mold` linker setup was tuned a bit *too aggressively*  
and now it refuses to play nice. Until I untangle that mess, I can’t produce new builds.  

I’ll post an update when it’s fixed.  
Meanwhile, huge thanks for being the **one brave explorer** actually running this build 🦊🔥
